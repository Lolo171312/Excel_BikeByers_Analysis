# Excel\_BikeByers\_Analysis



This project is based on a Kaggle dataset about bike buyers.

The goal was to clean the dataset, enrich it with new information, and build visual dashboards to better understand customer behavior.



\## Data Cleaning \& Preparation

To avoid altering the original dataset, the raw data was copied to a new sheet and then cleaned:

\- Removed duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.

\- Standardized values to avoid formatting issues.

\- Deleted irrelevant rows that contained unusable information.

\- Created a new column: "Age Bracket", grouping customers into three broader age categories (instead of exact ages), making analysis clearer and more meaningful.



\## Analysis with Pivot Tables

Pivot Tables were used to summarize key insights, such as:

\- Profitability segmented by gender.

\- The relationship between commute distance and bike purchases.

\- The number of bikes purchased by age group.

\## Visualization

\- Charts were created from the Pivot Tables to present findings in a clear and accessible way.

\- A dedicated Dashboard sheet was created to consolidate all visuals in one place.

\- Slicers were added, allowing interactive filtering by criteria such as gender, region, and education level.

\## Purpose

This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Excel, highlighting how raw data can be turned into meaningful insights.

It also serves as part of my portfolio, showcasing skills in data analysis, Pivot Tables, and dashboard creation.
